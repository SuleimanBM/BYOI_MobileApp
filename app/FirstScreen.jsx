            I want you to write down the things or activities in your life that
            you have already done and those that you are yet, wish or want to
            do, the purpose of doing this is to know what has happened and that
            have shaped or affected you. When life brings problems or
            misfortunes it shapes our{" "}

            and makes us think differently, but it also makes us who we are.
            These things you list are organically you, that's how we find out
            what we are made of and our real inner self, not a simple{" "}

            , its true society helps mold us but listing past experiences based
            on the fact of society doesnâ€™t define or makes you entirely.
          </Text>
          <Text style={styles.subtitle}>
            <Text style={styles.bold}>NB:</Text> This isn't an exercise. It's
            about clarification and identification of issues. Were you hold your

          <Text style={styles.subtitle}>
            Spend a little time clarifying the past in your timeline. A timeline
            is an incredibly objective method for marking down past occurrences
            in your life that you consider to be major, make it as if writing a
            rÃ©sumÃ©, and keep it simple, real, and condensed to the major effects
            or lessons learned from each past incident.{" "}
            <Text style={styles.bold}>
              (I might be asking you some of those past incidents and how they
              made you then and from what incidents you want to find yourself to
              nurture your real self now)
            </Text>
          </Text>
          <Text style={styles.subtitle}>
            When analyzing negative past experiences, focus on what you learned
            from them. Everyone has these in their timeline, but exaggerating or
            ignoring them won't help you. Instead, recognize that these
            experiences shaped you. Like someone said to me last night, 'I donâ€™t
            trust anymore', as a matter of fact; this could even be you. I don't
            know your past experiences and the incidents you found yourself in
            that is making you not trust anymore, but I can say based on those
            experience you were able to learn something from it, though it may
            be your opinion to others its a fact and decision you took to shape
            yourself, if not Iâ€™m sure the current and now you won't have any
            difference.

            <Text style={{ color: "#ffbb1c", fontWeight: "bold" }}>*</Text> For
            most people (it's more common than you may think) life is pretty
            easy to go through while on autopilot; we practically get handed a
            road map for how reality "works." Go to school, get a job, get
            married, think this, that, and the other, and bamm! hope you had a
            good time. It gets the job done certainly but it doesn't allow room
            for you. This is where you sit down with yourself. At the end of
            what you wrote down,{" "}
            <Text style={{ fontStyle: "italic", fontWeight: "bold" }}>
              come up with a few beliefs of yours that aren't based on logic

            , but are based on what you've been told. We all have them. Now,
            what do you actually think?
          </Text>
          <Text style={styles.subtitle}>
            Society has a very covert way of handling us the{" "}
            <Text style={styles.bold}>"misfits"</Text>, condemning the{" "}
            <Text style={styles.bold}>"losers"</Text>, idolizing the{" "}
            <Text style={styles.bold}>"beautiful"</Text>, alienating the{" "}
            <Text style={styles.bold}>"strange."</Text> But here's a heads up:
            These describing words have no basis in reality. How do you feel
            about the world around you? (could be your friends you have, family,
            the peer you find urself, etc...) Think about what you believe to be
            good and bad â€” not what anyone else has told you. Once you accept
            what others have told you it becomes your belief form and starts to
            affect you based on what you have accepted, and that now becomes
            your new road map to guide you. Once you don't get the right
            manual... I'm sure you know not just how life will be but the life
            you will live, all because of what someone told you or what u
            accepted, making it automatically your belief.
          </Text>
          <Text style={styles.subtitle}>
            Feel free to think more concretely. Do you actually agree with your
            parents' your peers or religious affiliations? Is having a degree,
            cooler friends or career really the most important thing to you? If
            the answer is no, great! There's absolutely zero problems with not
            molding yourself to pre-existing norms. Now all you have to do is
            <Text style={{ fontStyle: "italic", fontWeight: "bold" }}>
              {" "}
              unlearn and then relearn
            </Text>{" "}
            . Only this time, relearn based on your gut. its not going to be
            easy but you got to drop old habbits, more like the old you or
            totally drop{" "}
            <Text style={{ color: "#ffbb1c", fontWeight: "bold" }}>
              the chameleon or double life
            </Text>{" "}
            and relearn a new one based on your own belief system, molding your
            inner self to the new you. like i said its not going to be easy but
            you got to try, there are others out there to put you on the right
            track at least till you get on your feet to realise the real you.
          </Text>
          <Text style={styles.title2}>Start relying on yourself </Text>
          <Text style={styles.subtitle}>
            <Text style={{ color: "#ffbb1c", fontWeight: "bold" }}>* </Text>
            Confidence and reliance are at the heart of finding yourself. If you
            don't have a solid sense of self-worth, you'll listen to what others
            have to say all the time and to be swayed by their insistence on
            what is appropriate. Learn to believe in yourself and trust your own
            feelings. Then, you'll come up with a structure to base your new
            sense of self on. Remember, be patient with yourself and confident
            in your abilities. Everything will come with time.
          </Text>
          <Text style={styles.subtitle}>
            If you have been victimized in the past, confront those issues.
            They're not going to go away on their own. They might be coloring
            your approach to daily life, causing you to live up to other
            people's expectations instead of your own, just because someone did
            something to hurt you doesnt mean others will or wonâ€™t, the best you
            can do is learn from the incident and also the experience.
          </Text>
          <Text style={styles.subtitle}>
            Anyway start trusting your own judgment and decision-making
            processes, mistakes and all. We all make mistakes, but through
            mistakes we find ourselves growing, learning, and reaching our real
            selves.
          </Text>
          <Text style={styles.subtitle}>
            Start taking responsibility for budgeting, household matters, and
            planning about the future. People who lack a sense of self tend to
            disregard the "details" of life with a carefree attitude, believing
            that things will all sort themselves out. But things don't always
            sort themselves out. Taking responsibility pulls you back from the
            precipice and lets you be self-reliant and self-determined, no
            longer carried along by the waves of fate.
          </Text>
          <Text style={styles.title2}>
            Prepare to begin again with a clean slate
          </Text>

            <Text style={{ color: "#ffbb1c", fontWeight: "bold" }}>* </Text>
            Develop your own moral conduct and practice sticking to it. Start by
            overcoming bad habits. Stop over-eating and abusing sleep ðŸ™‚, my
            point is stop whatever that doesn't seem to move you forward, the
            stuff that doesn't seem to give you room to know who you really are.
            These are examples of lapses or habits that will prevent you from
            functioning at your peak. They also let you "off the hook" by
            sidestepping the analysis of why you use these crutches instead of
            finding better ways to brighten your life.

            This step may take some major rehabilitation for some individuals
            but putting it into the too-hard basket won't make it go away.
            Please note that, it's really important.{" "}
