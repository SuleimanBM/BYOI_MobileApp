            Accept that some people will think poorly of you no matter what you
            do. It's important to forget about what everyone else thinks because
            you cannot please everyone. And while you might not want to
            disappoint the people close to you, they should want you to be
            happy. As long as you continue to exist just to fulfill other
            people's ideas of who you should be, you'll never know who you
            really are.{" "}

            will become jealous, afraid, or overwhelmed when a person changes
            their usual habits and grows more mature and self-loving (others
            will love it). It's a threat to the relationship you've always had
            with others, and it forces them to take a cold, hard look at
            themselves, which they may not want to do. Give these people space
            and compassion; they may come around in time. If they don't, leave
            them be. You don't need them to be you.

            reasons: <Text style={styles.highlight}>*</Text> 1) Positivity is
            nourishing and can usher in a sense of happiness which being "lost"

            mind to new experiences and new people (that you previously wrote

            plain "uncomfortable". Getting out of your zone will not only teach
            you something, but it will force you to get to know you ‚Äî what
            you're capable of, what you like, what you definitely don't like,
            and what you were previously missing. If there‚Äôs no smile on your

            thoughts to slip to the back of your mind and be forgotten. If you

            your understanding of who you are and how you change. Instead of
            answering who you think you ought to be, keep it focused on who you
            actually are, because in all likelihood that's a very good answer,
            warts-and-all.
