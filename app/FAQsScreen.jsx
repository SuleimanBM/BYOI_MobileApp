            If finding yourself becomes really difficult, don't be afraid to ask
            other people for help. They can be a friend, family member, or
            psychologist.

            The reason behind this is due to the fact that you have not explored
            enough for what you like or dislike. Regardless of the reasoning
            behind if it was that one's being risk adverse or whatever it might
            be, <Text style={styles.highlight}>'change' </Text>
            needs courage and action. Though planning could be important, which
            seeking help from others can be helpful (Open up however you might
            feel and think during the conversation). Bottom-line is to take
            courses, interests groups, whatever appeals a little bit to you. Try
            anything until you have the one thing appeals to you that might give
            you the energy to get up every day.

            Forgetting about your past is not something that happens in a day --
            it takes time in doing that. But before you can forget about your
            past and move on, you need to forgive yourself first and let go of
            all past experience that brought nothing good. Read books when you
            have nothing doing, always engage yourself in something that will
            make you happy but not bored.

            The simple approach could be asking yourself the question of why you
            are afraid of the change and list them out for you to view. Try your
            best to understand the cause behind it but center the purpose of
            exercise with the <Text style={styles.highlight}>'I' </Text>and
            <Text style={styles.highlight}> 'me' </Text>rather than
            <Text style={styles.highlight}> you/them/they/We. </Text>On the
            other side, with a more novelty ways of approach can be asking
            yourself how much you want it? Because if you want it bad, you will
            get it no matter what. It will be difficult at any point in time of
            change there is no question about it. But the motivation and energy,
            or even called 'life' come from the fact that you are 'living' with
            your choice and intention, not surviving with the things that called
            'acceptable' to us.

            let the final choices, decisions, and acceptances be your own. If
            you simply give in to what others think, it will make finding
